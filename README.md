## My process

Even though this project does not need all these dependencies, I thought maybe this could be a good template for continued develompent or copy for other challanges. Feel free to use in your project. Good starting point using vite, postcss, tailwindcss, autoprefixer and cssnano (advanced-preset).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Multiple breakpoint design
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build and development tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Main framework for CSS styling
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - Post process styles
- [CSSNano](https://cssnano.co/) - Minify styles in postcss
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - Add vendor prefixes in postcss

### What I learned

If adding `flex-1` makes things complex, try dividing width like `w-1/2` (tailwind classes).
